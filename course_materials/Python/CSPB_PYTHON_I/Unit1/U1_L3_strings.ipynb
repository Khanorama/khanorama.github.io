    "In Python, a **string** is a sequence of characters used to represent text. Strings are created by enclosing text in single quotes (`'Hello'`), double quotes (`\"Hello\"`), or triple quotes for multi-line text (`'''Hello'''` or `\"\"\"Hello\"\"\"`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Strings can hold letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces, but they are always treated as text—even numbers within a string (`\"123\"`). They are **immutable**, meaning once created, their content cannot be changed directly. However, you can create new strings based on existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are highly versatile in Python and come with many built-in methods for manipulation, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concatenation**: Joining strings with `+` (e.g., `\"Hello, \" + \"world!\"`).\n",
    "- **Slicing**: Accessing specific parts of the string (e.g., `\"Hello\"[1:4]` gives `\"ell\"`).\n",
    "- **Methods (We will learn about this later)**: Functions like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.replace()`, and `.strip()` that make it easy to manipulate text.\n",
